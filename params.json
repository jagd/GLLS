Inspired by \r\nthe solution of magnetic fields in rotationally symmetric gyrotrons.\r\n\r\n#   Input\r\nThe input is written in ascii text, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    # the name of the unknown vector (only consist of letters)\r\n    I\r\n    # arbitrary number of name for the Y components of the linear system\r\n    # only consist of letters\r\n    Bz Br Psi\r\n    # the numerical coefficient matrix M \r\n    # Bz0  = M00*I0 + M01*I1 + ...\r\n    # Br0  = M10*I0 + M11*I1 + ...\r\n    # Psi0 = M20*I0 + M21*I1 + ...\r\n    # Bz1  = M30*I0 + M31*I1 + ...\r\n    # ....\r\n    1   2   3\r\n    2   3.3 4\r\n    5   6   7\r\n    4   4   3e8\r\n    # each line contains an equation, can include several ='s\r\n    Br0 = 0 = Br1\r\n    Bz1 + 5 = Bz0 * 2 + (2 + 4)*Bz3 = (Psi3 + Bz1*2) * 6 = (Bz0 + Bz2)\r\n    2*I1 + 1 = (1+2) * 3\r\n\r\n#   Output\r\nAfter solving the equation of `[M][I] = [B]`, the unknown vector will be \r\ngiven, in the above case the vector `I`.\r\n\r\n[least squares]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares\r\n",
